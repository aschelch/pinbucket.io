| ```php
namespace App\Console\Commands;
``` | Namespaces the class within the `App\Console\Commands` directory. |
| ```php
use App\Link;
use App\Jobs\ProcessLink;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
``` | Imports necessary classes:
    * `App\Link`: The `Link` model.
    * `App\Jobs\ProcessLink`: The `ProcessLink` job.
    * `Illuminate\Console\Command`: The base command class. |
| ```php
class ProcessOldLink extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'link:old';
``` | Defines the command's name and signature. It will be invoked using `php artisan link:old`. |
| ```php
    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Process old link without preview';
``` | Provides a description for the command, making it clear what it does. |
| ```php
    /**
     * Create a new command instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
``` | Initializes the command instance by calling the parent constructor. |
| ```php
    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        $links = Link::where('preview', NULL)->get();
        foreach ($links as $link) {
            ProcessLink::dispatch($link);
        }
    }
}
``` | Implements the `handle()` method, which is executed when the command is run:
    * Fetches all `Link` records where the `preview` field is `null`.
    * Iterates through each `Link` record and dispatches a `ProcessLink` job with the `Link` instance as an argument. |
