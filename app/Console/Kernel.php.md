## Introduction 

This code defines a `Kernel` class responsible for managing scheduled tasks and Artisan commands within a Laravel application. 

## Code Breakdown

### Namespace

The code begins by defining a namespace:

```php
namespace App\Console;
```

This namespace `App\Console` indicates that the `Kernel` class belongs to the `Console` directory within the `App` directory of the Laravel project. 

### Imports

The code imports several classes:

```php
use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;
use Carbon\Carbon;
```

* `Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule`: Provides the `Schedule` class for defining scheduled tasks.
* `Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel`: Represents the base `Kernel` class for managing Artisan commands.
* `Carbon\Carbon`: Provides functionality for working with dates and times.

### Kernel Class

The `Kernel` class extends the base `ConsoleKernel` class and defines three important methods:

#### Commands Property

```php
    /**
     * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $commands = [
        //
    ];
```

This property, `$commands`, is an array that stores a list of custom Artisan commands defined in the application. It's left empty here, suggesting that custom commands are likely defined elsewhere within the project. 

#### Schedule Method

```php
    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        // Heroku is only calling this everyday at 9am. So we filter to execute only on mondays
        if(Carbon::now()->isMonday()){
            $schedule->command('newsletter:send')->everyMinute();
        }
    }
```

This method, `schedule`, defines the schedule for running Artisan commands. It receives a `Schedule` object as an argument.

* Inside the `schedule` method, the code checks if it's Monday using `Carbon::now()->isMonday()`.
* If it is Monday, the code schedules the `newsletter:send` command to run every minute using `$schedule->command('newsletter:send')->everyMinute()`.

This logic suggests that the application sends a newsletter on Mondays only and uses Heroku for hosting. The code aims to ensure the newsletter is sent even if Heroku's scheduled task runs at an inconvenient time.

#### Commands Method

```php
    /**
     * Register the commands for the application.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function commands()
    {
        $this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands');

        require base_path('routes/console.php');
    }
```

This method, `commands`, is responsible for registering the application's Artisan commands. 

* It loads commands from the `Commands` directory within the current directory (using `$this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands')`).
* It then includes the `routes/console.php` file, which likely contains additional definitions of Artisan commands.

This structure ensures that all the Artisan commands in the application are properly registered and available for execution.
