## Introduction 

This controller is responsible for handling email verification for users who recently registered with the application. It also allows users to resend verification emails if they did not receive the original email. 

## Class Structure

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Namespace:** | `App\Http\Controllers\Auth` |
| **Class:** | `VerificationController` |
| **Traits:** | `VerifiesEmails` |
| **Properties:** |
    | `redirectTo`: string |  The URL where users are redirected after successful verification. Defaults to `/home`. |
| **Methods:** |  |

## Methods

### `__construct()`

This method is called when a new instance of the controller is created. It defines the middleware that should be applied to the controller's methods.

**Middleware:**

* **`auth`**:  Ensures that only authenticated users can access the controller's methods. 🔐
* **`signed`**: Applies only to the `verify` method. It ensures that the verification link is valid and has not been tampered with. 🔒
* **`throttle:6,1`**:  Applies to both the `verify` and `resend` methods. It limits the number of requests to these methods to 6 per minute. This helps prevent abuse and ensures the system remains responsive. ⏳

**Code:**

```php
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth');
        $this->middleware('signed')->only('verify');
        $this->middleware('throttle:6,1')->only('verify', 'resend');
    }
```
